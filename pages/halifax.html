              The Handley Page Halifax was a British heavy bomber of the Second World War. It was developed by
              Handley Page to the same specification as the rival Avro Lancaster, but was not as successful
              in service. The Halifax was used by both the Royal Air Force and several other Allied air
              forces, and was also operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force, the Royal Australian Air Force,
              and the Free French Air Force. The Halifax was designed to carry a heavy bomb load, and was
              equipped with a variety of defensive armament. It had a crew of seven and was powered by
              four Bristol Hercules radial engines. Despite its heavy armament, the Halifax was
              relatively slow and was vulnerable to enemy fighters. However, it was used extensively in
              night bombing raids and played a significant role in the bombing of Germany.
