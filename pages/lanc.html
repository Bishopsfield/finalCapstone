            <p id="lancaster">The Avro Lancaster was a British four-engined Second World War heavy bomber. It was
                designed and manufactured by Avro as a contemporary of the Handley Page Halifax,
                both bombers having been developed to the same specification, as well as the Short Stirling,
                all three aircraft being four-engined heavy bombers adopted by the RAF during the same
                wartime era. The Lancaster had its origins in the twin-engined Avro Manchester which had
                been developed during the late 1930s, but which had failed to meet the RAF's requirements.
                A larger design, the Avro Lancaster was developed and first flew in 1941. The Lancaster was
                a major component of the RAF's bombing campaigns and was heavily involved in the famous
                Dam Busters raid of 1942. With a total of 7,377 Lancasters built, it became the most produced
                bomber during the war, and was used by many other Allied air forces.
