              The de Havilland Mosquito was a British twin-engine, multi-role combat aircraft that
              was used during World War II. It was designed by de Havilland's chief designer,
              R. E. Bishop, who began work on the design in 1938. The Mosquito was made
              largely of wood, which made it a difficult target for radar and gave it a very high speed.
              It was used in a variety of roles, including as a bomber, reconnaissance aircraft,
              and night fighter. The Mosquito was particularly successful as a night fighter, and it
              was credited with shooting down over 700 German aircraft during the war. Despite its
              wooden construction, the Mosquito was a highly successful aircraft, and it remained
              in service with the RAF and other air forces long after the war.
