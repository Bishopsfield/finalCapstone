            <p id="controversy">Allied bombing of Germany during World War II was a contentious issue, as
              it resulted in significant civilian casualties and destruction of civilian
              infrastructure. The bombing campaign, known as the Strategic Bombing Offensive,
              was carried out by the Royal Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces.
              The goal of the campaign was to weaken Germany's war effort by destroying
              its industrial and economic capabilities. However, the bombing also resulted
              in the deaths of an estimated 600,000 German civilians, and the destruction
              of homes and cultural landmarks. Critics argue that the bombing was
              indiscriminate and morally unjustifiable, while supporters argue that it
              was necessary to bring an end to the war and save lives in the long run.

            <h2>Introduction<span class = "linkit" name="Introduction" idref="intro">Save for later</span></h2>
            <p id="intro">During World War II, the British Royal Air Force (RAF) employed a variety of 
              aircraft in their bombing campaigns against Germany and other Axis powers.
              The most famous of these bombers was the Avro Lancaster, which was used for
              high-altitude bombing (and the precision, low-level 'Dam Busters' raid),
              and was known for its heavy payload and long range.
              Other notable aircraft used by the RAF included the Handley Page Halifax,
              which was used for night bombing, and the Short Stirling, which was the
              RAF's first four-engine heavy bomber. The de Havilland Mosquito, a twin-engine,
              multirole aircraft, was also used by the RAF as a bomber, reconnaissance aircraft
              and night fighter. These bombers played a crucial role in the war effort
              by carrying out bombing raids on enemy industrial and military targets,
              and helped pave the way for the eventual Allied victory.</p>
              <p>Over 55,000 British and Commonwealth airmen lost their lives in action
                over Europe during the conflict.</p>
