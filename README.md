Final capstone project
## Description
This is my first website. It's important because it includes HTML, CSS and JS - three of the key disciplines I've been studying with Hyperiondev. Key learnings employed are:
* CSS, including:
  *  DIV and SPAN
  *  Manipulation through JS
* Event listeners and callback functions
* URL manipulation for images in the 'save for later' page
* Use of local storage to allow object persistence
